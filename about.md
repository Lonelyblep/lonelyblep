<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hi, this is new. I have never done a self description that didn't require me to get mad conceited and praise myself from third person writing as a comedic genius. Yes, just typical small stand up comedian shit. But here I am in front of you, as Lonelyblep. My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/lonelyblep" target="_blank">Reddit persona</a> that many redditors from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty" target="_blank">r/AsianBeauty</a> for advice regarding your luxury skincare needs, especially with Sulwhasoo! My name is Jack, if you prefer to call me that :)</p>

<p>I am a 18 year old (yes many questions raised, let's leave them for the FAQ) Chemical Engineering student from Saigon, Vietnam. But other that I am also a skincare curator, a stand up comedian, cooking enthusiast, vocalist/singer for my school's art team, and English teacher in training.</p>

<p>On this personal blog of mine, I want to let you into my world of beauty, cooking, memes and personal ruminations of mine about life and the beauty industry. I'd like to make sure that you know the difference between my blog and other beauty blogs (not to knock them). This is a personal blog that has a focus on beauty. You mostly know me from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asianbeauty" target="_blank">r/AsianBeauty</a> for my luxury Asian skincare reviews, most notably Sulwhasoo. But I post so infrequently because I have so many other brands from other regions that I haven't tried!! I want to show you the best of the best here, not just the best of Asian skincare and cosmetics. You will also get to know me through other activities I do with daily life such as horsing around and cooking. I'll also talk (or rant) a lot about certain issues about the beauty industry, anything that catches my eye, predicting or just straight up manifesting new launches from my favorite brands, and some beauty culture and history because that is so important and interesting to know to me!! Get ready for a kaleidoscope of mainly beauty related news from someone who is absolutely infatuated with everything about skincare, from the science, formula, packaging, scents and marketing. I will make sure to dissect every aspect imaginable of each product I write about.</p>

<p>I have a focus on luxury products generally because I have more experience dealing with them from day to day because of my customer base, but I'll include some affordable favorites of mine of course!! Hoping you enjoy the content on my site!!</p>

<p>It's a me!
<br>Lonelyblep!</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p class="question">You reviewed a lot of anti-aging skincare, when you were under 18?</p>
<p class="answer">I usually test new stuff with my grandma to see how well a product performs on it's targeted skin type. But the surprising thing I found was that anti aging skincare (maybe except for super strong actives) do benefit my younger skin to some extent. I will not be able to reap the full benefits of some of these products but they do bring some brightening, moisturizing and pore tightening properties on my skin. My MO is that I never sell anything I haven't tried. I try the products out to check for scent and textures, to know enough to write about it. 
</p>

<p class="question">How can you afford all this stuff?</p>
<p class="answer">Lots of samples, plus I work with sales agents from official distributors so I get free product sometimes. I do buy the product as an investment if I can't get it for free and think it can do a lot of good so I can potentially sell it later. I split the cost with my grandma for the product if she also uses them. I use it for the first month or so and she can have the product after.
</p>

<p class="question">How long have you been selling skincare?</p>
<p class="answer">Late 2016.</p>

<p class="question">How long have you been interested in skincare?</p>
<p class="answer">Over 11 years ago, when I was in 2nd grade (yes for real) I'd google for hours every day about all the new skincare and their chemical compositions. I still do that now.</p>

<p class="question">Do you formulate your own skincare?</p>
<p class="answer">I have been practicing it since 2018 and now I do sell just simple stuff like aftershave to friends at a very very small scale, as a hobby. After I get a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering I intend to get a Master's degree in Cosmetic Engineering to then hopefully work for a company long enough to get experience for opening up my own. I have many novel ideas for skincare, haircare and cosmetics I want to bring to life.</p>

<p class="question">How'd you start selling skincare? And why luxury skincare at that?</p>
<p class="answer">l always gave my friends skincare advice because of my knowledge and they always loved that the advice always worked, so they kept sending pictures of their skin improving day by day. One day I was showing my grandma these pictures and boasting about how I managed to clear my friend's acne, she tasked me with rescuing her sallow, sagging skin. She insisted that I recommend her the best of the best, even if it's more pricey. So naturally I led her to Sulwhasoo (which was the best skincare brand I knew at the time) and her skin dramatically improved that everyone in the family had noticed just by a quick glance. My dad soon knew about this and recommended me to his long time friend who happened to be a rich lady. It was my first big order. After she is thoroughly satified with her skin, she recommended me to other rich friends of hers. And thus the cycle continues. I served as their personal skin concierge, tracking progress every week, checking in every bit of the way. I honestly didn't ever expect myself to be a skincare curator ever. I thought I'd be an IT technician or baker ðŸ¥´
</p>

<p class="question">How did you come to Reddit?</p>
<p class="answer">Well I was simply selling The History of Whoo at the time and was kinda tired of people asking me what each line meant all the time (and I admit it's hard to remember or even distinguish if you're not Korean), so I decided to do a guide of the line names in Vietnamese to clarify for customers. But I figured people are still confused even in a country where Whoo is extremely popular, what is it like in Western countries where they have little to no information about it? That's why I translated my guide to English and added my personal thoughts of each of the products to help readers make up their mind about a purchase. I saw the positive feedback my guide got so I decided to do just that with a brand I have fully mastered: Sulwhasoo.

<p>I would like to thank my dearest friend/sister from another mister <a href="https://www.brainsoup.me" target="_blank">An Pham</a> for helping me with the conceptualization and creation of this blog site. She made this pretty tribute to the early 2000s aesthetic, nodding to my birth year. Amazing web designer yo, and yes she had to manually insert this credit part in herself too because I have no idea how to.
