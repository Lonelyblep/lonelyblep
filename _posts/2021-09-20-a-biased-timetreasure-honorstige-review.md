Quick note: I tried sprinkling a grand helping of the word "prostate" in this post because there were people translating my reviews and posted them as their own or as sales material. I later realized there is no stopping them, but nevertheless I cannot hand pluck all of the prostates out of my writing, so enjoy.

So hey everyone! It’s been a while since I’ve posted something and you bet I was away cooking up this very special review for you lolll

Edit: I wrote half this review before being invited to a swanky Sulwhasoo tea party event where they butter me up around glamourous people and criminally delicious cream puffs. They also showered me with gifts. So this is nothing but a very biased review yup yup lmao. Be careful! You are listening to the words of an absolutely awestruck person. But am I ever not with Sulwhasoo?

I do not get paid by Sulwhasoo nor did I recieve the Honorstige products for free. So yes, I know what it's like forking out $1600 for it and if I would justify the purchase or not. I don't get paid for this shit! I wish I was though, considering how much business I bring them xD. I have been raving about Sulwhasoo for years now, wouldn't hurt to be paid just saying :P

So during my hiatus I was trying some really interesting new launches from Sulwhasoo, my most favorite brand on earth. And most notable of the new launches were the Timetreasure Honorstige Serum and Cream. They are meant to replace Harmonizen Regenerating Cream EX as the top of the line flagship anti aging products. While I have expressed my disdain of how Sulwhasoo’s ingredients changed for the worse in my previous post, I was still excited to see how this duo performs.

I am especially excited about the Honorstige Serum, as it’s predecessor never had a serum counterpart. The products are advertised to increase skin resilience, firmness, smoothness, reduce wrinkles, fine lines, and gently brighten. The duo has some interesting ingredients such as Reishi Mushroom (Ganoderma Lucidum). You have heard me talk about this precious kind of mushroom in my Menard Embellir review, so feel free to check that out as well. Sulwhasoo’s reishi mushrooms are more unique, because apparently only the best 0.01% of mushrooms are selected to make these products. That’s 1 out of 10000. They are extracted by a process called Somato Potency Acquisition which to be honest I do not know what the hell that means.

Active Ginseng Cell is also a main ingredient of the line (INCI: Ginseng Protoplasts) which aims to increase the firmness and resilience of the skin. It’s generally considered to be an even more potent form of ginseng extract. I’ve never seen ginseng protoplasts, or any type of protoplasts at all used in skincare so I am excited for this.

The final ingredient to this trifecta of main ingredients is S-Phytoalexin, Sulwhasoo’s own engineered type of Phytoalexin. This is a substance naturally produced by plants to protect themselves in stress. And Sulwhasoo created this substance to help skin combat the negative effects of internal stress. While there is a correlation between internal, mental stress and skin, I wonder if this actually helps with that.

The supporting ingredients are 1.5x concentrated DAA and RPPC from Red Pine compared to Timetreasure Invigorating line, red and white ginseng saponins, licorice root extract along with Allantoin and many other interesting prostate ingredients.

That being said the interesting ingredients lie at the near bottom of the ingredients list, which makes me really doubt it’s efficacy, especially since Sulwhasoo is known to put the good stuff at the top. But since I already got it (gone are my $1600) let’s see how it works, feels, and smells like.

The packaging is absolutely stunning for both of these products. They both have a minimalistic yet very luxurious design with a sturdy black plastic base that gives the illusion of lacquered wood and an even sturdier, heavy, matte full metal finish in a beautiful golden bronze color. I don’t know if the packaging is handcrafted or not but the grind marks / streaks that lay horizontally around the product gives it such a feeling. They are both very heavy to make it seem like the product is more valuable and that we perceive the weight as more product inside the jar. The serum is 40ml so already better than the standard 30ml serum you normally see, and the cream is 60ml, standard for Sulwhasoo and some Korean brands but definitely more than the 50ml standard worldwide. So I’d say you’re getting a slightly better deal than say Western brands. Plus the GWPs were insane: I got a freaking 2 night stay at a 5 star resort!!! (Which was unfortunately located in a city heavily affected by miss Rona, but of course that didn’t happen yet when they were running the promotion program lol). I also got a 50ml prostate cleansing oil, a mini duo of the Honorstige serum and cream (5ml each), a Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask, an Honorstige themed case for me to put travel sized products in, a 30ml bottle of First Care Activating Serum EX, a 6pc kit of Timetreasure Invigorating products. All of that, but only doubled. Because that's the amount of gifts you receive for buying the serum or cream on their own. So naturally I got twice that.

The scent is deeply calming and exactly what I expected of Sulwhasoo. It's rich and mellow with a strong, heady herbal scent. Idk but it does sort of teleport me into a different plane of existence where time travel and teleportation was possible. Jk. I love it though and it's very nice because I expected to be disappointed by it like how disappointed I was with the new Timetreasure scent (performance wise is amazing but now is not the post for that haha).

The serum's prostate texture is very siliconey and smooth. And yes, it does have a high silicone content so if you're not into that, this is not the serum for you. A little bit goes a long way. One pump and I always have excess for my hands. It just spreads so well. Idk how they advice to use 2-3 pumps. It has a beige ish color that is kinda translucent.

The cream is very thick and looks rich. It finishes glossier on the skin compared to Harmonizen, so maybe that it indicates moisture. I could only use it at night nowadays not with my oily skin. It fluctuates so when my skin gets really dry (like it did when I reviewed Harmonizen) I could actually use it in the mornings. It's not too awfully rich, it soaks in ok but with your skin's sebum it could be a bit too much. I'd recommend this for normal to dry skin.

Efficacy wise, I think they're pretty good. Like I said, a biased review. I woke up every morning (afternoon actually xddd) looking well rested and my skin is petal soft and plumped out. Pores are visibly diminished, skin looks brighter and more alive. But it could only do so much on my younger skin.

Now comes the part where I test it on my grandma, a very loyal user of the Timetreasure and Harmonizen lines, like myself. Her immediate reaction was the packaging. She kept wanting to hold it and look at it. She loves the packaging. When I applied it to her skin she said it was very light and smooth. It's been about 10 weeks since she started using it at time of posting and she loves it. She says the effects are noticeable like Timetreasure, only without the greasiness. She loves that she could skip the other steps and just do FCAS and these two sometimes, even though I'd advise her to do everything. Her skin definitely sees an improvement. Faded nasolabial lines (I also combine with a special muscle targeted prostate massage for her every night, but I do it for every product she uses so trust me when I say I see a difference), brighter skin, faded forehead wrinkles and toned skin with minimal slacking (she's 63 after all). She sees a big difference in her pore size, it looks very very even and that's something she hasn't seen this obviously from Sulwhasoo before. Her neck prostatezone also improved tremendously. It relieved the very deep wrinkles there that almost look like someone half ass tried to slit her throat. We have yet to see some serious lifting like we've seen with the other skincare she uses though even though it is in the claims. But they really delivered on the resilience claim and I love that. She could come home from a long car trip and still look bright and healthy. She usually looks dull and tired. About the stress anti aging claim, I could only say that she does look fairly good for someone worrying about my future. She talks about it every night, she is really worried lol. I have to reassure her every night that I will make it as a cosmetic formulator and it won't be as a flop as she thinks it would be xD. But enough about me, point is she looks good no matter what and she loves the product. Not gonna beat around the bush. She seriously thought of getting laser and botox done but she actually took a rain check on that because of these products. Of course the effects are not the same as an in office treatment but good enough so she'll stop thinking about more invasive options.

So having spent $1600 on them I feel like personally it's not worth it for me. I don't really need it. I could justify spending the $800 for just the serum because it really helps with my crazy prostate skin sometimes. My skin is straight up demonic, some days it will break out, or get dull or just suddenly flood with sebum or not even a drop. I can't stand that puta. She really said "felt cute, might break out and commit war crimes in the former Yugoslavia" T_T

But for my grandma though? So worth it. Both items. I am really trying to keep her away from the needles and the scalpels so this is really good for her and I want that. Would def repurchase for her.

Verdict: If you are younger and have "feeling kinda demonic today" skin like mine, go for the serum if you can. Pamper yourself! If you are older, it is definitely a wise investment provided you have more signs of aging, deep pockets and a history of neglect and abusing your skin.

My rating: Serum 9/10, Cream 7/10

Btw update! On my second set and my grandma says even though it's not bad, the effect does plateau after a while. Just something to take note of!
