Hey y'all! It's been an AWFULLY long time since I've done a full brand review. Most of you remember me for my Sulwhasoo brand review and many have said that now Sulwhasoo came out with so many new products and renewals with their brand reinvention and wanted to hear my thoughts on the new products and the brand themselves. So here goes! Note: Any products not mentioned in this post are either not updated since my last post, discontinued or I just feel the same way about them after many years.

\-Essential: Introduction series to Sulwhasoo, cheapest as well too. Lovely hanbang scent, reliable moisture and refining effect.

+First Care Activating Serum: They removed the EX from the name and put the word Advanced on the outside carton, but not on the bottle itself. Sulwhasoo was tampering with my faves and I was not having it, so I was scared to see what they'd done to my long time HG. To my surprise, I literally can't tell the difference. So there's that. I still love it and that's one less thing they fucked up on lately.

+Essential Revitalizing Serum EX: not updated since my last post but I just wanna say wow.. the texture and scents feels so much like Honorstige. Talk about Dom Perignon taste on a Bud Light budget.

\-Essential Perfecting: sub line of Essential line, started exclusively for Amore counselors for door to door sales but expanded into stores as well.

+First Care Activating Perfecting Serum: No different from regular FCAS, just packaging difference.

+Essential Perfecting Water: Never tried but [u/Gyeongreedy](https://www.reddit.com/u/Gyeongreedy/) told me it is like the original but without alcohol so if you're not into alcohol this is good news.

+Essential Perfecting Emulsion: Not tried, it looks interesting though. But I am going to guess not so different from the original emulsion.

+Essential Perfecting Moisturizing Cream: Not tried, could be a replacement to the now-discontinued Hydro Aid Soothing Moisturizing Cream.

+Essential Perfecting Firming Cream: Idk how this is different from the regular essential firming cream. Also not tried. I sorta don't get the point of this line.

\-Ginseng: Their iconic line since the beginning of the brand. Many renovations and extensions have been made for this line over the oast few years.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Water: Sulwhasoo's thickest and most hydrating toner yet, I can see oily skinned people using it as a serum. Could get sticky fast. And my friend who was a K Beauty skeptic said this calmed down her irritation faster than the moisturizer she uses. Score for Sulwhasoo.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Emulsion: Lovely ginseng scent. Very thick. You definitely need to have dry skin for this kind of product and unfortunately my skin got oiler over the years. You can use this as a dupe for the ginseng cream if you want the moisture.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Ampoule: A bi-phase ampoule meant to be fused together with a twist of the dial and finished in 3 weeks. Improves multiple aging signs of tone, texture, pores, clarity, wrinkles and hydration. I can confirm after 3 weeks of combining with the Concentrate Ginseng Renewing Serum my skin feels smoother, looks poreless and brighter and my grandma reported a plumpness and elasticity in the skin. Great product and do not let the thin texture fool you, it is rich when you put it on your skin.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum: I want to correct one thing in my previous review. This is not as stretchy as it's predecessor and it is lighter as well. I have determined that while it is good for producing smooth, glowing results for my clients, it is not as good as the predecessor and not as hydrating.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Facial Oil: yeah I still love the texture, scent and finish of this oil. It's still my HG for those self care nights. I just can't use it as much now that my skin is oilier. Same price and size as the ampoule above but I felt ampoule was so much more worth it so go for this after you have tried the ampoule.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Eye Serum Mask: This is a dual layer eye mask with a hydrogel layer soaked with eye serum and a layer outside to prevent evaporation. It smells amazing and it's hydrating but honestly it's a flop. It does not solve the problems it claims to and my grandma and I both do not see any substantial improvement to our eye zones after finishing a box.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream EX: Formula stayed the same but I'd like to say that now that my skin is oiler I find this cream to be just the right amount of comforting. Not good for super oily skin types though. I still dont like the wseird runny texture that is hard to pick up with the spatula.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream Light: As I said before you are paying for less ginseng per jar for this one but I much prefer the texture of this to the original one now. It finishes way lighter despite having a thicker texture than the original.

+Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Mask: No formula change. This still works the best for my grandma, it's like an instant lift. The thing is it's not very sustainable for the environment and not cost effective. (Coming from me? How rich.)

\-Snowise: Brightening line. Okay imma be upfront. It sucks at lightening dark spots. Better at brightening the whole skin tone. And they tampered with my favorite products in here which make me so mad for real. Lovely scent though.

+White Ginseng Radiance Mask: see "Special care"

+Snowise Brightening Cleansing Foam: I'm scorned. My favorite pH 5.5 cleanser with sexy foam is now pH 6.9 and drying. It's not bad but it is nothing. NOTHING. Compared to the old version. I hate it here :(((

+Snowise Brightening Water: Very good at refining pore appearance, moisture does not last but now having oily skin I have come to appreciate it more.

+Snowise Brightening Serum: Light watery gel texture, beautiful luminosity and clarity. But I feel like I got better results with Cle De Peau intensive brightening serum so sticking to that. Plus the price is pretty much the same for the two.

+Snowise Brightening Emulsion: Very light. Lovely for daily moisture and just no complaints with this one. Unproblematic. Glowing.

+Snowise Brightening Mask: you should really try this once in your life. It's an intensive brightening effect. I heard many people say they got it wrong by not removing the mesh before putting it on their skin and I'm just like... no words. I can't believe I have to remind y'all but please dooooo

+Snowise Brightening Spot Treatment: See I like it for small spots but for bigger spots the best it could do is soften the edge of the spots. I did not see visible improvement of spots after long term usage.

+Snowise Brightening Cream: Yup this is very nice for combination skin. It's great for creating clarity and smoothness. A lot of people like this and I can see why.

+UV Wise Protector: Comes in two shades/types. SPF 50/PA++++ and Anti Pollution (micro dust). Creamy Glow leaves a light dewy finish with no tint and is richer in moisture. Tone Up Milk has a pink tint that gently lifts the skin tone, looks natural and has a light oil control effect. The Tone Up Milk kind also has blue light (HEV) protection. Now while HEV has only been shown to cause hyperpigmentation in darker skin types, I would still like to avoid it because there also hasn't been a conclusion that HEV DOES NOT cause aging and other skin problems. I just like to be safe. As for the texture I like both, I really can't complain about anything but the size. I've learned to use body sunscreen on my face because of it's bulk. I realize it is the only cost realistic way for daily UV protection done properly. Because sunscreen isn't just a dot. It's 2mg per square centimeter of the face.

\-Bloomstay: Successor line to Innerise, designed for younger skin as a simple routine to increase skin radiance and vitality. Not my favorite line but it's certainly not bad either, it's Sulwhasoo, the bar is never too low. The formulas haven't been changed since my last post but my opinion of the range has. The scent for this line is my least favorite (but still a favorite because honestly Sulwhasoo never gets their scents wrong, the worst they could do is "good")

+Bloomstay Vitalizing Water: It's very light and hydrating. Not a standout product but it's nice. If you like to treat yourself then go on and get this toner. It's 150ml, a slightly more generous size than the regular 125ml for Sulwhasoo waters. I like it with the 7 skin method.

+Bloomstay Vitalizing Serum: While I love the clarifying and soothing effects of this serum, I do find it to be a tad too sticky, which is why I will not repurchase.

+Bloomstay Vitalizing Eye Cream: Now this eye cream is nothing like I've ever seen before. It's not quite a gel or a standard cream. It's more like a clear putty that melts under your skin's warmth. I like this, it's very smoothing, hydrating and serves as an excellent base for concealer. Not much of a brightening effect though. Also I notice I go through this wat faster than the other Sulwhasoo eye creams, and the size is 20ml just like the Ginseng eye cream.

+Bloomstay Vitalizing Cream: I remember liking it when I had dry skin but now that my skin is oiler I surprisingly still like it as a night cream. It's rather nice and smooth and gives you a nice glow.

\-Timetreasure: Now with twice D-AA compounds from red pine and Red Pine Purifying Component. Generally I'd say this line works better and soaks in faster than the old version (also meant less moisture, so dry skin me hated that but now I'm ok), but I hate the new smell. It's too perfumey and it isn't the same rich alluring woodsy pine scent that I love so much. I would kill to have the old scent back.I cannot stress how much I miss the old scent. They should sell it as perfume. I'd buy it at any price.

+Timetreasure Extra Creamy Cleansing Foam: The scent for this one has always been different from the rest of the line and I love it. This one was never updated. It's got a thick rich foam that is a unctuously soft. It does moisturize well but after a while I've found that it stops at just not drying. It's high pH so keep that in mind. And I would not call this gentle cleanser nor would I recommend for dry sensitive skin, it works well for me to clear my skin out though. Definitely worth the higher price since a pea size could lather up to clouds of foam. The whole tube could last you a year.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Water: Oil infused water with high anti aging properties. This is very hydrating, I love this one. It's great for just soothing the skin and replenishing it after a rather potent cleanser like the Timetreasure cleansing foam. I get that very soft, silky skin feeling every time I use it.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Serum: Now this is very siliconey compared to it's predecessor which was more like a rich emulsion type. It is very lightweight, readily absorbed (the old one was not) and greatly effective for wrinkles, sallow skin tone, elasticity and moisture. The lifting effect is not as strong as it's predecessor.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Emulsion: I also like this because it has nice slip which allows you to use less cream (which is the real $$$ of the collection), it is hydrating to the extent you want it to be by adjusting the amount and it's just a lovely texture on top of the previous Timetreasure products. It's richer than the other emulsions that Sulwhasoo have too. I wouldn't say it's an absolute necessity, but if you have oily/combo skin this could serve as your sole moisturizer.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Eye Serum: The texture is quite like the facial serum of this line, I also noticed the lifting effect was diminished compared to the old version but as for wrinkles and elasticity it is very effective. Combined with the golden eye massager it makes for a luxurious experience and your eyes do look very wide awake after using them together.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Eye Cream: I like that it kept the same texture as it's predecessor, that fluffy rich cream. I also like that they adapted it in a way that feels lighter, more comfortable and more accessible to those who avert rich products for eye care. It's very moisturizing with a smooth texture, generous size and just very good for firming if used in the long haul.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Cream: This cream is brown colored like the previous version, still feels rich yet so much lighter and less tacky on the skin than the predecessor. It almost wraps your skin in all the moisture that the other steps have given you and has a very noticeable firming effect when combined with massage. Skin looks radiant and pores are controlled.

+Timetreasure Invigorating Sleeping Mask: Daaaamn this is some sticky stuff right here. It's not something I want to apply after the cream and all that. I feel like it's overkill. If used on it's own it imparts a nice radiance and luster to the skin and makes it sort of rosy almost. I'm not wearing this on top of the usual Timetreasure routine though, not gonna happen.

\-Timetreasure Honorstige: Sulwhasoo's peak line, replacing Harmonizen. It combines active ginseng cell (ginseng protoplasts), S-Phytoalexin and rare Reishi mushroom (only 0.01% of the Reishi produce is selected for Honorstige production). Please refer to my separate post on these two products for more information.

+Timetreasure Honorstige Serum: My favorite of the two. Light, absorbing and all around skin improving.

+Timetreasure Honorstige Cream: I still like Harmonizen more but this is also nice. Luxurious texture, fragrance and efficacious. Non greasy. Not a stretch to say it is Sulwhasoo's best cream amongst their current offerings. I also love that it has a refill. You can save 100 bucks on it. Just the cap alone costs 100 dollars ffs 🤣 but it is undoubtedly beautiful and the packaging virtually never ages. Good if you feel the Timetreasure Invigorating Cream was too light for you.

\-Special Care: A collection of products for supplementary use according to skin needs.

+White Ginseng Radiance Refining Mask: This product went through 2 reformulations between now and the time of my previous post. Firstly it was changed from Snowise Brightening Exfoliating Gel in a tube to Snowise Brightening Exfoliating Mask in a tub. This update proved to be horrible. Then it was updated to it's current name, separating itself from the Snowise line and into the Special Care line. It smells of ginseng, with ginseng powder that you can see and feel. The powder is suspended in a stretchy, hydrating gel base. My skin feels quite soft after using this but the insane clarity I got with the original (2 reformulations ago) was gone. I did not feel like my skin had that special translucent glow anymore, so I am very disappointed.

+Overnight Vitalizing Mask: Now this I felt the reformulation did it justice. It was hydrating, smoothing and wore beautifully on my skin at night. I woke up with plumped, radiant and nourished skin. Generous size. Lovely entry price point. Definitely many people's gateway drug to Sulwhasoo. I could not ask for more.

+Clarifying Mask: A peel off type mask that smells deeply of herbs, Sulwhasoo's #1 facial mask with almost 90,000,000 million units sold. I get the appeal. It's generously sized, feels luxurious and refines the skin texture. I really feel like it cleans my skin very well. I don't believe in the word "detox", because that to me is bullshit. But this mask did something close to that by cleaning away some things my daily cleanser couldn't reach.

+Herbal Clay Purifying Mask: I was excited that Sulwhasoo came out with a clay mask since The History of Whoo, their competitor, came out with the Yeol clay mask that I really loved. This mask comes with fine herbal grains, and dries softly on the skin. You won't get that insane tugging feeling you get with Innisfree or especially Kiehl's clay masks. This actually didn't do much for me so I'm quite disappointed. I will be using the Yeol mask and Kiehl's turmeric clay mask for the time being.

+Benecircle Massage Cream EX: I would've loved this if I hadn't used the older version. I preferred the smell and texture of that one more. This massage cream turns into oil which has nice slip but I feel it needs to have a bit more grip on the skin for an effective massage. I also preferred the old herbal smell much more. But this new product isnt entirely all that bad.

+Herblinic Ampoules: My favorite when I have breakouts. I use this with the Herbal Soap and it's the only thing I apply on my skin along with FCAS. Works every time. Funny because it doesnt say anything about acne. I just know it works for occasional breakouts. I never noticed it's other effects though.

+Herbal Soap: Soap rich in herbal extracts and ginseng, cured over 40 days. Pretty drying, but always works for breakouts. I never use this for too long though.

+Serenedivine Oil: Multi use oil. I use this for facial massage and mixing into foundation. It is lighter than the ginseng oil and has many ingredient similarities, but Ginseng oil is the best for facial treatment by far. I like that it comes it different scents though.

+Gentle Cleansing Oil: Highly efficacious, nourishing cleansing oil. Been my favorite for years. No complaints.

+Gentle Cleansing Water: It's very refreshing and could work for a lazy day. I reach for this when I feel the oil doesn't rinse clean sometimes.

+Gentle Cleansing Foam EX: A mild foaming cleanser with neutral pH. Lovely scent. It doesn't stand out but it certainly is a crowd pleaser.

+Lip Masks: I prefer the pink one in Moisture to the Recovery green one because I feel the more malleable texture spreads more easily on my lips and quickly corrects dryness and chapping.

+Luminature Glow Cream: Successor to the Luminature Essential Finisher EX that I loved so much. It's just a high moisture glossy cream that you wear as a skincare finisher. I do not like the feeling of this laying on top of my moisturizer, but I like the feeling of foundation when it goes on top. I also dread applying a moisture rich sunscreen on top of it. The previous version was more generously sized and gave me an unmistakably transclucent glow with a light texture, while keeping it bright through the day.

+Elastic Neck Cream: This is not really a favorite of mine. It does not seem to work.
