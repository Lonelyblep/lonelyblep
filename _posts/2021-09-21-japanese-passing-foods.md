Hey y'all, I'm presenting to you the first cooking post of this blog. So a quick life update. I have been living in the middle of nowhere instead of Saigon, where I'm supposed to be because I wanted to stay somewhere with a lower population density (because y'know, covid). Sometimes certain types of foods or ingredients can't reach where I live because everyone has to stay inside, including delivery people for a while now. Later when we decided it was not the right move, the travel ban was revoked for delivery workers now but not for the rest of us. This means the reappearance of a few familiar foods. I was ecstatic to find panko breadcrumbs at the mom and pop today because it meant back to me frying some wicked shit in my kitchen. 

Japanese food is probably my all time favorite, even more than Vietnamese food (sorry). I love sushi, sashimi and just anything that has the signature umami taste from seafood and kelp that is unadulterated by cooking or any sort of complex seasoning. I'm a whore for seafood. And I want Japanese food. Now the thing is my dad hates seafood so we only ever have pork or beef at home. And I was determined to make something Japanese. And with the pork and panko crumbs I've decided to go for tonkatsu. In case you don't know what it is, it's a seasoned piece of pork that is breaded in panko and deep fried. Idk if I'm someone you should turn to for recipes but I will tell you what I put inside in case you wanted to make it. Btw I wanted to make tonkatsu but didn't have the rights seasonings for it, so I just made up my own.

 I'll tell you what's inside but no measurements because I only use vibes.

Pork, marinate that bih with seasoning/boullion powder, MSG, pepper and some salt. Very simple. Then after 30 minutes or so just do the ol' breading. Dip them in beaten eggs and roll around in panko, and yes you can double dip if you're about that crunch. Fry for 4 minutes for thin cuts of meat, and up to 7 for thicker pieces.

The next morning, I decided that I wanted more Japanese food still, so I looked around the fridge, scrambling to think of what other Japanese dish I could make. And there it was, omurice. A healthy serving of stir fried rice, nestled in a cocoon of silky smooth omelette. It sounded simple, but to make a good omurice is not easy. I knew my digestion was gonna suffer after this because technically there's no veggies in here. I love eating veggies but they are nowhere to be found as of right now. I had to make do.

 In an large oiled pan, fry some minced garlic until golden, then toss in some leftover rice (it's less likely to be mushy when you're done cooking it, compared to fresh rice), a generous splash of Japanese soy sauce (has to be real Japanese soy sauce like Kikkoman, where's it's less salty than common soy sauce and has a prominent fermented flavor), dark soy sauce (optional, but this one is a thicker Chinese soy sauce which lends some sweetness, umami and aromatics), oyster sauce, MSG, ketchup, pepper, your favorite fixings (like veggies or cheese) and like a teeny little bit of sugar. After everything is well combined, transfer every single grain of rice onto a plate. Now if you have a nonstick pan there should be enough grease to keep frying the omelette in, if you don't have one then add some extra oil. Beat 4 eggs with a bit of mayo to really bring it together and prevent the yolk and white from separating. Fry in pan on medium low heat, until most of the egg is cooked. Don't cook it all the way through. Put the fried rice on one half of the omelette, flattening it and then fold the omelette over to create the omurice shape. Serve on plate and garnish with ketchup.

And that was me trying to make Japanese-passing foods. Until next time yo.
